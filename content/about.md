# Hi there

My name is Ben and I'm a Microsoft employee and an Azure Ace for Windows Virtual Desktop. Since I am constantly improving my skills I started this personal blog to develop and train my coding, writing and knowledge sharing skills. Fingers crossed my code/samples as accurate as possible.

We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content. Enjoy reading.

## Who am I

My **"tech"** career started in 1995 when I poured my hot chocolate over my father's brand-new Windows NT 3.5 workstation.

- LinkedIn
- GitHub
- Instagram

So, there you have it... enjoy!

One of my first projects will be to enable social sharing for this HUGO Theme.
